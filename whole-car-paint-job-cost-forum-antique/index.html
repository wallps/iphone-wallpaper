<p>High end cars have always been painted to a different standard to low price cars. The other 10 is in the painter and sliding him an extra 100 before they roll your car. I would say 2-3K for a good paint job is definitely attainable so long as your car isnt a rust bucket with a bunch of dents. This price is strictly for painting only base paint and clear coat and it applies to most full-sized sedans. Im considering using Rustoleum or any other good quality paint for all my projects from now on. If you do the prep work yourself and the shop just had to shoot the paint then you can probably get down to the 250-500 range at cheap shops like maaco or one day. 19 Paint Jobs These Car Owners Definitely Regret.</p>

<p>Most of the cost comes from all the work to get ready to paint before the first container of paint is ever opened. A good paint job on a Mustang will cost between 10000 to 12000. A gallon of good automotive paint costs 500 I think u either need 25 or 3 gallons to paint a regular sixed car. The main cost is labor but paint and other items are very expensive today.

<p>I took it to a different shop a few years later and it wound up costing about 13k for a paint job that I cant take my eyes off of. Most paint shops will try to rip you off. The prices we found ranged from 220000 to upwards of 1000000 with some higher than 3000000 depending on the car paint scheme trim and bodywork needed for that specific classic car or vehicle. Im considering using Rustoleum or any other good quality paint for all my projects from now on. I couldnt tell you a good shop but Ive heard to get a decent paint job its generally between 3-6k USD. Eg Ford hosed the paint on Rolls Royce hand painted it and polishd the finish with pumice So the year of the car can dictate the type of paints avaliable at the time then the standard of work has to be worked out.

<p>Average for a GOOD lasting paint job is 5k. My paint clear and materials for my last paint job minus the 150 hours of prep and body work were around 1200 dollars. And remember this price will fluctuate depending on the size of your car and the actual price that Maaco bids you for the paint job.

If you want to repaint your entire vehicle with a different color you should be aware that the job can be expensive.
