<p>All states waive certain fees and tests for vintage cars. For that reason they set rules stating what qualifies as antique. Organizations such as the Classic Car. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars. Much like falling in love with the looks of an older car is subjective so too is the definition of a classic or antique car. According to dictionaries the word classic refers to something that over a period of time is considered the highest quality is outstanding and is one of a kind.

<p>Yet in many states you can register a car as an antique or a historic car after 20-25 years. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. A subset of what is considered classic cars are known as antique cars or vintage cars manufactured pre-World War II. Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique. This interpretation takes us back to 1987 when the Ford Sierra the Vauxhall Cavalier and the Austin Metro were popular.

<p>What constitutes a vintage car depends on whos defining it but as a rule of thumb its a car that was built before 1930 1925 by some definitions so its a car from the very early days of motoringexcept anything that has been modified into something like a hot rod. Though that is putting it broadly. If there are quite a few of the vintage cars available purchasing one with the expectation of reselling it at a profit may be a risky investment. This interpretation takes us back to 1987 when the Ford Sierra the Vauxhall Cavalier and the Austin Metro were popular. Typically by state law a car or truck that is over 40 years old is considered to be an antique. When people encounter the word antique they typically think of a dusty wooden cabinet or a grandfather clock from the 19th century. 1931 Duesenberg J Tourster American Car Best In Show Duesenberg Car Cool Old Cars Car.</p>
