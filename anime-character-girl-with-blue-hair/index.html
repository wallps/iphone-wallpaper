<p>Blue hair might not exist naturally (unless you dye your hair blue or wear a wig), but in anime, the hair color is quite common. Miko�s friends at school are assaulted by demons and her professor is kidnapped and sent to their infernal dimension; They are secured in place with oversized scrunchies that are. A character�s hair color says a lot about their personality, and in anime even more so. Post any character you know with those colors! Firstly, it is so because of its unusual hair color, and, secondly, because of its inner look that is not similar to any other my oc character hari in 2019 Anime, Anime red hair, Cute.</p>
