Antique cars are over 45 years old and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930. In Florida for example vehicles must be at least 30 years old to qualify for antique or historic designation.</p>

<p>Certain states have specific designations for antique vehicles deeming them historic as opposed to comparatively newer classic cars. Classic a matter of opinion often based on the cars style production numbers or critical reception but classics can include some cars as young as five years old. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years. By contrast American Collectors Insurance says an antique car is one manufactured in 1975 or earlier. Typically an antique vehicle is defined by its age at the time at which antique vehicle.

On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. The one exception is Oregon.

<p>Most states consider a car to be an antique once its 25 years old. This interpretation takes us back to 1987 when the Ford Sierra the Vauxhall Cavalier and the Austin Metro were popular. Antique vehicle registration is a special form of motor vehicle registration for vehicles that are considered antique classic vintage or historicBoth the specific term used and the definition of a qualifying vehicle vary from country to country as well as within a country if it is a federation.

<p>This interpretation takes us back to 1987 when the Ford Sierra the Vauxhall Cavalier and the Austin Metro were popular. The dictionary describes an antique as a piece of furniture tableware or the like made at a much earlier period than the present It is commonplace to recognize an antique as over 100 years but this timescale is sometimes disputed by experts with items aged between 50 and 80 years often being classified as antique. Cars older than 25 years have antique status which means no safety inspections and registration renewals spaced out to either 3- or 5-year intervals. Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques. There are those who believe that a car becomes an antique at 15 20 or 25 years. Answer 1 of 3.

As with many subjects in the classic car scene opinions on these definitions and categories differ depending. It should again have been repaired and maintained in a way that keeps it true to its original design and specifications. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. This is based on the definition given by most of the worldwide organization and the Antique Automobile Club of America. Some states will also issue special classic car license plates to antique cars.
